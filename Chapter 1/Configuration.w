[Configuration::] Configuration.

To parse the command line arguments with which inweb was called,
and to handle any errors it needs to issue.

@h Instructions.
The following structure exists just to hold what the user specified on the
command line: there will only ever be one of these.

As with any complex tool, Inweb has a welter of command-line switches and options,
and for clarity here we break them down into individual CLIs for each subcommand.
Thus, switches for one subcommand are inaccessible in the others. In this section
of code, we manage only a handful of shared settings, together with some functions
providing a common set of conventions for parsing the most common settings.

=
typedef struct inweb_instructions {
	int subcommand; /* our main mode of operation: one of the |*_CLSUB| constants */
	int verbose_switch; /* |-verbose|: print names of files read to stdout */
	struct pathname *import_setting; /* |-import X|: where to find imported webs */

	struct inweb_weave_settings weave_settings;
	struct inweb_tangle_settings tangle_settings;
	struct inweb_inspect_settings inspect_settings;
	struct inweb_make_settings make_settings;
	struct inweb_map_settings map_settings;
	struct inweb_test_language_settings test_language_settings;

	struct text_stream *temp_colony_setting; /* |-colony X|: file or path, if supplied */
	struct text_stream *temp_member_setting; /* |-member X|: sets web to member X of ls_colony */
	struct pathname *temp_path_setting; /* project folder relative to cwd */
	struct filename *temp_file_setting; /* or, single file relative to cwd */
} inweb_instructions;

@h Reading the command line.
The dull work of this is done by the Foundation module: all we need to do is
to enumerate constants for the Inweb-specific command line switches, and
then declare them.

=
inweb_instructions Configuration::read(int argc, char **argv) {
	inweb_instructions args;
	@<Initialise the args@>;
	@<Declare the command-line switches specific to Inweb@>;
	args.subcommand = CommandLine::read(argc, argv, &args,
		&Configuration::switch, &Configuration::bareword);
	return args;
}

@<Initialise the args@> =
	args.subcommand = NO_CLSUB;
	args.verbose_switch = FALSE;
	args.import_setting = NULL;

	InwebWeave::initialise(&(args.weave_settings));
	InwebTangle::initialise(&(args.tangle_settings));
	InwebInspect::initialise(&(args.inspect_settings));
	InwebMake::initialise(&(args.make_settings));
	InwebMap::initialise(&(args.map_settings));
	InwebTestLanguage::initialise(&(args.test_language_settings));

	args.temp_colony_setting = NULL;
	args.temp_member_setting = NULL;
	args.temp_path_setting = NULL;
	args.temp_file_setting = NULL;

@ The CommandLine section of Foundation needs to be told what command-line
switches we want, other than the standard set (such as |-help|) which it
provides automatically.

@e VERBOSE_CLSW
@e IMPORT_FROM_CLSW
@e USING_CLSW
@e COLONY_CLSW
@e MEMBER_CLSW

@<Declare the command-line switches specific to Inweb@> =
	CommandLine::declare_heading(U"inweb: a tool for literate programming\n\n"

@ Foundation calls this on any |-switch| argument read:

=
void Configuration::switch(int id, int val, text_stream *arg, void *state) {
	inweb_instructions *args = (inweb_instructions *) state;
	if (InwebWeave::switch(args, id, val, arg)) return;
	if (InwebTangle::switch(args, id, val, arg)) return;
	if (InwebMake::switch(args, id, val, arg)) return;
	if (InwebMap::switch(args, id, val, arg)) return;
	if (InwebInspect::switch(args, id, val, arg)) return;
	if (InwebTestLanguage::switch(args, id, val, arg)) return;
	switch (id) {
		/* Miscellaneous */
		case VERBOSE_CLSW: args->verbose_switch = TRUE; break;
		case IMPORT_FROM_CLSW: args->import_setting = Pathnames::from_text(arg); break;
		case USING_CLSW: {
			filename *F = Filenames::from_text(arg);
			if (TextFiles::exists(F)) {
				WCL::make_resources_at_file_global(F);
			} else {
				pathname *P = Pathnames::from_text(arg);
				if (Directories::exists(P)) WCL::make_resources_at_path_global(P);
			}
			break;
		}

		/* The alternate way to specify a web as a colony member: */
		case COLONY_CLSW: args->temp_colony_setting = Str::duplicate(arg); break;
		case MEMBER_CLSW: args->temp_member_setting = Str::duplicate(arg); break;

		default: internal_error("unimplemented switch");
	}
}

@ Foundation calls this routine on any command-line argument which is neither a
switch, nor an argument for a switch. For the Inweb subcommands, this means it
is specifies a web, or else a file, or else a path. Details are written into
the temporary settings first, because they can only be understood in the light
of other settings which might not have been made yet.

	inweb_instructions *args = (inweb_instructions *) state;

	int used = FALSE;

@h Main operand.
Most of our subcommands take a single main operand, which is deduced from the
temporary settings made above. Our aim will be to produce one of these objects:

=
typedef struct inweb_operand {
	struct wcl_declaration *D;
	struct ls_web *W;
	struct ls_colony *C;
	struct ls_colony_member *CM;
	struct filename *F;
	struct pathname *P;
} inweb_operand;

@ Our exact wishes depend on the subcommand used. On the other hand, we want to
apply consistent conventions for different commands as far as possible. So we
compromise and allow subcommands to choose what they will allow in the main
operand, but otherwise use the same rules for all of them:

@d NO_OPERAND_ALLOWED 0
@d WEB_OPERAND_ALLOWED 1        /* i.e., a web, a path, or a file */
@d COLONY_OPERAND_PREFERRED 2   /* ditto, but in ambiguous cases, choose a ls_colony */
@d WEB_OPERAND_DISALLOWED 3     /* i.e., a path or a file only */
@d WEB_OPERAND_COMPULSORY 4     /* i.e., a web only */

@ A further tweak is that we sometimes want the web to be read in a particular
way (if a web is what is provided). If |enumerating| is set then values will be
assigned to enumerated constants found in the web -- this is unnecessary most
of the time, and will be meaningless or impossible if only a subset of the web
is being considered. If |weaving| is set, then certain sorts of code rewriting
are not performed (for example, the I-string constants like |I"this"| used in
the InC language are not rewritten as their regular C implementations).

@ The conventions below are very carefully arranged, which is always a warning
sign in any algorithm. The aim is to infer as much as possible from as little
input as possible, that is, to allow the user to be vague... but not too vague.

=
inweb_operand Configuration::operand(inweb_instructions *ins, int requirement,
	int enumerating, int weaving) {
	if (requirement == NO_OPERAND_ALLOWED) @<Fail if any operand was supplied@>;

}

@<Fail if any operand was supplied@> =
	if ((Str::len(ins->temp_colony_setting) > 0) ||

	if (colony_file) {
		op.C = Colonies::load(colony_file);
		if (op.C == NULL) Errors::fatal_with_file("not a valid colony file", colony_file);
	}

@ So this looks at the text |C| from |-colony C| or else from |C::M|, if either
of those syntaxes was used. If we are here, |C| is non-empty. It should either
be a valid filename, or a valid directory name for a directory containing either
a |colony.inweb| or |colony.txt| file.

@<Locate the colony file from its setting@> =
	colony_file = Filenames::from_text(ins->temp_colony_setting);

		}
	}
	if (TextFiles::exists(colony_file) == FALSE)
		Errors::fatal_with_text("cannot find a colony file for '%S'",
			ins->temp_colony_setting);

@ This alternative strategy is used if no such colony text is provided. That
doesn't mean there is no colony file in play: just that the user hasn't specified
it. If we can in fact find a colony file close to the relevant file or above
the relevant path, we'll use that.

@<Try to find a nearby colony file@> =
	pathname *search = NULL;
	if (ins->temp_file_setting) search = Filenames::up(ins->temp_file_setting);
	else if (ins->temp_path_setting) search = ins->temp_path_setting;

	if (TextFiles::exists(CF)) colony_file = CF;

@ This looks at the text |M| from |-member M| or else from |C::M|, if either
of those syntaxes was used. Note that it's absolutely necessary for a colony
file to exist and be valid, on order for this to make sense, and moreover |M|
has to be one of its member names; lastly, there must actually be a web in
the place that the colony file says it will be.

@<Find the member@> =

@ So here we have a single file, and try to read it as WCL. WCL is a format
which can hold multiple different sorts of resource: a WCL file can explicitly
say what kind it holds, but if it doesn't, we have to guess that from context.
Here's where we do the guessing.

@<Read this file as WCL resources@> =
	int presume = MISCELLANY_WCLTYPE; /* i.e., make no assumptions */
	if ((requirement == WEB_OPERAND_COMPULSORY) ||
		(inferred_web_as_ls_colony_member)) presume = WEB_WCLTYPE;
	else {
		if (Str::eq_insensitive(Filenames::get_leafname(ins->temp_file_setting), I"colony.inweb"))
			presume = COLONY_WCLTYPE;
		if (old_inweb_compatibility_mode) {
			TEMPORARY_TEXT(ext)
			Filenames::write_extension(ext, ins->temp_file_setting);
			if (Str::eq_insensitive(Filenames::get_leafname(ins->temp_file_setting), I"colony.txt"))
				presume = COLONY_WCLTYPE;
			if (Str::eq_insensitive(ext, I".inwebc"))
				presume = WEB_WCLTYPE;
			if (Str::eq_insensitive(ext, I".inwebsyntax"))
				presume = NOTATION_WCLTYPE;
			if (Str::eq_insensitive(ext, I".ildf"))
				presume = LANGUAGE_WCLTYPE;
			DISCARD_TEXT(ext)
		}
	}
	op.D = WCL::read_for_type_only_forgivingly(ins->temp_file_setting, presume);

@ A single file will only be a web if it's not already been parsed as something
else (say, a language definition); a path will only be a web if it contains a
contents section.

@<Try to read our file or path as a web@> =
	if ((op.D == NULL) || (op.D->declaration_type == WEB_WCLTYPE)) {
		if (((ins->temp_path_setting) &&
			(TextFiles::exists(Filenames::in(ins->temp_path_setting, I"Contents.w")))) ||
			(ins->temp_file_setting)) {
			op.D = WCL::read_web_or_halt(ins->temp_path_setting, ins->temp_file_setting);
			op.W = WebStructure::read_fully(op.C, op.D, enumerating, weaving, verbose_mode);
		}
	}

@ The most notable thing here is that we make an attempt (no more than that) to
reconcile things in the case where the user has not specified a colony or member,
only a web, but where there is a colony file nearby which we have auto-detected.
Is the web a member of that colony or not? If it seems to be, we'll fill in |op.CM|.
But it's probably not wise to rely too much on this.

@<Tidy up our findings@> =	
	if (op.W == NULL) {
		op.F = ins->temp_file_setting;

@h Range operand.
Some subcommands take a further operand called a "range", usually after a |-only|
setting. These are in addition to a main operand, not instead of it, and indeed
make sense only in the context of the main operand specifying a web.

Subsets of a web are represented by short pieces of text called "ranges". This
can be a section range like |2/pine|, a chapter number like |12|, an appendix
letter |A| or the preliminaries block |P|, the special chapter |S| for the
"Sections" chapter of an unchaptered web, or the special value |0| to mean the
entire web (which is the default).
