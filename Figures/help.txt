inweb: a tool for literate programming

Inweb is a system for literate programming. It deals with 'webs',
programs written in conventional programming languages like C (which
Inweb calls 'languages') marked up in human-readable ways to reveal
their structure and explain their motivation. Inweb can handle multiple
markup syntaxes (which it calls 'notations'). It can also group together
multiple webs into connected masses, which it calls 'colonies'.

Inweb is an all-in-one tool for LP which is divided up into subcommands,
each able to perform a different task. 'inweb tangle' and 'inweb weave'
are the two used constantly: tangling processes a web into a form
which can be compiled, and weaving makes it into something human-readable.

Usage: inweb COMMAND [DETAILS]

where the DETAILS are different for each COMMAND.

The following subcommands are available:

    inweb weave
    inweb tangle
    inweb inspect
    inweb make-readme
    inweb make-gitignore
    inweb make-makefile
    inweb map
    inweb advance-build
    inweb test-language

Use 'inweb help COMMAND' for more on each command.

The following options are always available:

-at X             specify that this tool is installed at X
-colony X         if the newer 'colony::member' notation is problematic, use this and '-member'
-crash            intentionally crash on internal errors, for backtracing (default is -no-crash)
-fixtime          pretend the time is 11 a.m. on 28 March 2016 for testing (default is -no-fixtime)
-help             print general help information
-import-from X    specify that imported modules are at pathname X
-locale X         set locales as 'L=E', L being shell or console, E platform, utf-8 or iso-latin1
-log X            write the debugging log to include diagnostics on X
-member X         if the newer 'colony::member' notation is problematic, use this and '-colony'
-using X          making Inweb resources in the file or path X available to all webs
-verbose          explain what inweb is doing (default is -no-verbose)
-version          print out version number
