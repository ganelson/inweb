# This is "macosintel.mkscript", a script which defines build settings used in
# inweb, intest, inform and all of their subsidiary tools for the platform
# "macosintel". The maintainer of this file is Graham Nelson.

# The script is used for two purposes. Firstly, it is used to generate the
# file "macosintel.mk" of platform settings. If an inweb user selects macosintel as
# platform on a first run, then this is the file copied into place as
# inweb/platform-settings.mk. But secondly, it also defines macros which
# can be used by any *.mkscript files being converted to *.mk files on
# this platform.

# Do not edit "macosintel.mk" directly. Instead, edit this script, and then
# rebuild "macosintel.mk" by setting the current working directory to the directory
# _above_ "inweb", and using the command:

# inweb/Tangled/inweb make-makefile inweb -script inweb/Materials/platforms/macosintel.mkscript -to inweb/Materials/platforms/macosintel.mk

# Or simply:

# make -f inweb/inweb.mk makers

# which recreates all of the make-files in the inweb repository from their
# scripts, including macosintel.mk among them.

# See the inweb manual for documentation on the *.mkscript file format, i.e.,
# the format in which this file is written. But it is essentially just a makefile
# with a number of special macro and loop features whose syntax involves braces
# { ... }, so anywhere that you see braces, you're looking at something special
# to *.mkscript; anything else is straightforward make syntax.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The first definition in this file should set INWEBPLATFORM to the platform
# name, which is the same as the leafname of this file without the ".mkscript"
# file extension. So:

INWEBPLATFORM = macosintel

# The I6 source code has its own set of symbolic names for operating systems,
# not always the same as inweb's names for platforms, so:

INFORM6OS = MACOS

# On some platforms, executables have a specific file extension, which we define here:

EXEEXTENSION = 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# These are likely to be the same on all platforms:

INTEST = intest/Tangled/intest
INWEB = inweb/Tangled/inweb

# Request the path of MacOSX.sdk:

SDKPATH := $(shell xcrun -show-sdk-path)

# Now three macro definitions: two for compiling C code to *.o object files
# (one being strict about warnings, the other indulgently suppressing them);
# and one for linking those *.o files into an executable.
