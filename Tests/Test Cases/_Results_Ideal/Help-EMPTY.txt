inweb: a tool for literate programming

Inweb is a system for literate programming. It deals with 'webs',
programs written in conventional programming languages like C (which
Inweb calls 'languages') marked up in human-readable ways to reveal
their structure and explain their motivation. Inweb can handle multiple
markup syntaxes (which it calls 'notations'). It can also group together
multiple webs into connected masses, which it calls 'colonies'.

Inweb is an all-in-one tool for LP which is divided up into subcommands,
each able to perform a different task. 'inweb tangle' and 'inweb weave'
are the two used constantly: tangling processes a web into a form
which can be compiled, and weaving makes it into something human-readable.

Usage: inweb COMMAND [DETAILS]
