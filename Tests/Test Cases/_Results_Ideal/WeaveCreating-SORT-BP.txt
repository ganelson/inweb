    # Counting Sort

    _An implementation of Harold H. Seward's 1954 sorting algorithm._

    ## Introduction

    This algorithm was found in 1954 by [Harold H. Seward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_H._Seward),
    who also devised radix sort. They differ from most sorting techniques because they do
    not make comparisons between items in the unsorted array. Indeed, there are no
    comparisons in the following function, only iteration.

    ## Implementation

    This function takes an array of non-negative integers, sorts it, and returns
    the result. The test `if unsorted` means "if the unsorted array is not empty",
    and is needed because Python would otherwise handle this case badly: of course,
    if `unsorted` does equal `[]`, then so should `sorted`, and so the right answer
    is returned.

    	def countingSort(unsorted):
    		sorted = []
    		if unsorted:
    			{{initialise the incidence counts to zero}}
    			{{tally how many times each value occurs in the unsorted array}}
    			{{construct the sorted array with the right number of each value}}
    		return sorted

    For example, suppose the array is initially `[4, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3]`.
    Then the maximum value is 6. Python arrays index from 0, so we need an incidence
    counts array of size 7, and we create it as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

    {{initialise the incidence counts to zero}} =

    	max_val = max(unsorted)
    	counts = [0] * (max_val + 1)

    In the unsorted array we will observe no 0s, one 1, three 2s, and so on. The
    following produces the counts `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2]`.

    {{tally how many times each value occurs in the unsorted array}} =

    	for value in unsorted:
    		counts[value] += 1

    Unusually for a sorting algorithm, an entirely new sorted array is created,
    using only the incidence counts as a sort of program. We fill `sorted`
    with no `0`s, one `1`, three `2`s, and so on, producing `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6]`.[1]

    [1] The unsorted array is no longer needed, in fact, and so we could easily make this
    algorithm "sort in place" by simply rewriting `unsorted`, rather than making
    a new array.

    {{construct the sorted array with the right number of each value}} =

    	for value, count in enumerate(counts):
    		sorted.extend([value] * count)	

    ## Testing

    We will use this holon for all of our unit tests on different sorting algorithms:

    {{Tests}} (webwide and tangled late) =

    	print("Let's see, then:");

    So let's get started by testing this one:

    {{Tests}} +=

    	A = [4, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3]
    	print("Unsorted:", A)
    	print("Sorted by Counting Sort:", countingSort(A))

    ## Verdict ^"verdicts"

    So how did we do? What makes count sort interesting is that it is not doomed
    to run at $O(n\log n)$ or worse speed, where $n$ is the size of the data set:
    counting sort runs at $O(n+k)$, where $k$ is the size of the largest value in
    the data (called `max_val` above). With most data, $k$ is either enormous or
    at least unpredictable, so that speed and memory usage both spike. But for just
    a few applications, where $k$ is known to be within tight bounds, count sort
    is still used today and is exceptionally fast.

    # Quick Sort

    _An implementation of Tony Hoare's 1959 sorting algorithm._

    ## Introduction

    A divide-and-conquer strategy created in 1959 by [Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare),
    Quicksort remains divisive even today. Unlike //Counting Sort//, it makes
    comparisons, and has a very low memory overhead, except for stack usage
    when recursing. Invented rather surprisingly on a visit to Moscow, Hoare having
    trained as a classicist and then learned Russian in the navy, Quicksort became
    almost ubiquitous in the 1970s when it was adopted by the standard C library as
    `qsort`, the only sorting function provided. In some ways Hoare's most important
    insight was that recursion could be important. Many early compilers did not
    allow a function to call itself, directly or indirectly, and it was algorithms
    like Quicksort which persuaded programmers to change all of that. 

    ## Implementation

    Essentially the idea is to divide the list at a "pivot" value, making swaps
    so that all the terms lower than that come before the pivot, and all the
    terms higher come after it. If sorting a great pile of library books, you might
    put all those with authors A to L on one table, and all those from M to Z on
    another: that would be a pivot on L. Each table would still have a unsorted
    mass of books on it, but you would have reduced one big sorting problem to
    two smaller ones. Recursively, you'd then sort each table, for example dividing
    table 1 into A to E and F to L, and so on.
    	
    	def quicksort(array, low=0, high=None):
    		if high is None:
    			high = len(array) - 1
    	
    		if low < high:
    			pivot_index = partition(array, low, high)
    			quicksort(array, low, pivot_index-1)
    			quicksort(array, pivot_index+1, high)
    	
    The function `partition` divides the given segment of the list (i.e., `array[i]`
    with `i` running from `low` to `high`), herding lower terms before the pivot
    and higher ones after; it returns the _index_ of the position where the pivot
    ends up, not the value. In our books analogy, the pivot value might be a book by
    Lyons, Zachary, so that all the A to L books come before it, and all the M to Z
    books after. If there are 457 books before it, then the pivot book would be at
    index 457 (counting from 0), and this is where it will appear on the final
    shelf when the sort is complete - so each partition does definitely put at least
    one book in the correct position, after which it never moves again.

    	def partition(array, low, high):
    		{{choose a pivot value}}
    		{{move lower elements to the front}}
    		return pivot_ends_at

    In principle you could choose any value as the pivot, but while any choice would
    ultimately lead to a sorted list, they do not all get there equally quickly.
    There are many schemes for the choice: this is the simplest, attributed to Nico
    Lomuto, which simply picks the last element in the (unsorted) list.

    For example, applied to `[2, 6, 15, 12, 12, 10, 14, 1, 7]`, it will
    choose 7 as the pivot value, in position 8:

    {{choose a pivot value}} =

    	pivot_starts_at = high
    	pivot = array[pivot_starts_at]

    We now run through the array looking for terms `<= pivot`, and make swaps
    to accumulate them in the range `array[low]` to `array[leading_edge]`:
    we'll call these the "early terms". `leading_edge` begins at `low-1` because
    the run of early terms is initially empty.

    Note that the Python iteration `for j in range(low, high)` runs `j` from
    `low` to `high-1`, and therefore never reaches `pivot_starts_at`. Note also
    that sometimes the apparent swaps in this code do nothing: if `j` and
    `leading_edge` are equal, which happens if there's an initial run of values
    below the pivot, for example; or if `pivot_ends_at` comes out the same
    as `pivot_starts_at`, which happens if the pivot was the highest value all
    along.

    {{move lower elements to the front}} =

    	leading_edge = low - 1
    	for j in range(low, high):
    		if array[j] <= pivot:
    			leading_edge += 1
    			array[leading_edge], array[j] = array[j], array[leading_edge]
    	pivot_ends_at = leading_edge + 1

    	array[pivot_ends_at], array[pivot_starts_at] = array[pivot_starts_at], array[pivot_ends_at]

    On the list `[2, 6, 15, 12, 12, 10, 14, 1, 7]`, `j` therefore iterates
    from 0 to 7:

    - iteration 0 invisibly swaps 2 and 2, growing the early terms to `[2]`;
    - iteration 1 invisibly swaps 6 and 6, growing the early terms to `[2, 6]`;
    - iterations 2 to 6 do nothing because those entries are above the pivot value;
    - iteration 7 swaps 1 and 15, changing the array to `[2, 6, 1, 12, 12, 10, 14, 15, 7]`,
      and growing the early terms to `[2, 6, 1]`.

    All that remains is one final swap of 7 with the first 12 to put the pivot value
    at the end of the early terms, giving `[2, 6, 1, 7, 12, 10, 14, 15, 12]`, and to
    return its final position, which is 3. We have cut the array into `[2, 6, 1]`
    before the pivot, all less than or equal to 7, and `[12, 10, 14, 15, 12]` after,
    all greater. Note the potential for _instability_ here: the two 12s started out
    adjacent to each other, but have now split up. It's anybody's guess which way
    round they will end up.

    ## Testing

    And this code tests the function:

    {{Tests}} +=

    	my_array = [2, 6, 15, 12, 12, 10, 14, 1, 7]
    	quicksort(my_array)
    	print("Unsorted:", my_array)
    	print("Sorted by Quicksort:", my_array)

    ## Verdict ^"verdicts"

    Clearly what we _hope_ is that the partition will, on average, roughly halve
    the size of the list, so that the depth of recursion is about $\log_2(n)$.
    For example, a list of 20 items might partition first to leave sublists of
    size 9 (before pivot) and 10 (after). The list of 9 obligingly then pivots
    as 4 before, 4 after; the list of 10 as 4 and 5. These all split as 2 and 1
    or 2 and 2. After each division we have to do roughly $n$ operations, so
    we then get a running time of $O(n\log_2 n)$.

    Unfortunately there's nothing to stop each partition from dividing the list
    in the worst possible way, e.g., partitioning 20 items into 19 before the
    pivot and 0 after; then partitioning the 19 into 18 and 0; and so on. And
    this is exactly what Lomuto's scheme does if the list is already sorted in
    ascending order, resulting in $O(n^2)$ running time. On randomised data that
    would hardly matter, because it would be so unlikely, but in practical
    cases, data to be sorted is often misaligned only slightly or not at all.
    Many naive implementations of Quicksort have therefore followed Lomuto down
    the road to perdition. A common defensive tactic is to randomise the list
    before sorting.

    <p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP5" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;5. Verdict.</b>  So how did we do? What makes count sort interesting is that it is not doomed
    to run at \INWEBMATH(O(n\log n)\INWEBMATH) or worse speed, where \INWEBMATH(n\INWEBMATH) is the size of the data set:
    counting sort runs at \INWEBMATH(O(n+k)\INWEBMATH), where \INWEBMATH(k\INWEBMATH) is the size of the largest value in
    the data (called <code>max_val</code> above). With most data, \INWEBMATH(k\INWEBMATH) is either enormous or
    at least unpredictable, so that speed and memory usage both spike. But for just
    a few applications, where \INWEBMATH(k\INWEBMATH) is known to be within tight bounds, count sort
    is still used today and is exceptionally fast.</p>

    Quicksort remains divisive even today. Unlike <a href="cnsr.html" class="internal">Counting Sort</a>, it makes
    comparisons, and has a very low memory overhead, except for stack usage
    when recursing. Invented rather surprisingly on a visit to Moscow, Hoare having
    trained as a classicist and then learned Russian in the navy, Quicksort became
    almost ubiquitous in the 1970s when it was adopted by the standard C library as
    <code>qsort</code>, the only sorting function provided. In some ways Hoare's most important
    insight was that recursion could be important. Many early compilers did not
    allow a function to call itself, directly or indirectly, and it was algorithms
    like Quicksort which persuaded programmers to change all of that.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="lsmarkdown">
    <p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP2" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;2. Implementation.</b>  Essentially the idea is to divide the list at a &quot;pivot&quot; value, making swaps
    so that all the terms lower than that come before the pivot, and all the
    terms higher come after it. If sorting a great pile of library books, you might
    put all those with authors A to L on one table, and all those from M to Z on
    another: that would be a pivot on L. Each table would still have a unsorted
    mass of books on it, but you would have reduced one big sorting problem to
    two smaller ones. Recursively, you'd then sort each table, for example dividing
    table 1 into A to E and F to L, and so on.</p>

    and higher ones after; it returns the <em>index</em> of the position where the pivot
    ends up, not the value. In our books analogy, the pivot value might be a book by
    Lyons, Zachary, so that all the A to L books come before it, and all the M to Z
    books after. If there are 457 books before it, then the pivot book would be at
    index 457 (counting from 0), and this is where it will appear on the final

    Lomuto, which simply picks the last element in the (unsorted) list.</p>

    <p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP6" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;6. Verdict.</b>  Clearly what we <em>hope</em> is that the partition will, on average, roughly halve
    the size of the list, so that the depth of recursion is about \INWEBMATH(\log_2(n)\INWEBMATH).
    For example, a list of 20 items might partition first to leave sublists of
    size 9 (before pivot) and 10 (after). The list of 9 obligingly then pivots
    as 4 before, 4 after; the list of 10 as 4 and 5. These all split as 2 and 1
    or 2 and 2. After each division we have to do roughly \INWEBMATH(n\INWEBMATH) operations, so
    we then get a running time of \INWEBMATH(O(n\log_2 n)\INWEBMATH).</p>
    <p>Unfortunately there's nothing to stop each partition from dividing the list
    in the worst possible way, e.g., partitioning 20 items into 19 before the
    pivot and 0 after; then partitioning the 19 into 18 and 0; and so on. And
    this is exactly what Lomuto's scheme does if the list is already sorted in
    ascending order, resulting in \INWEBMATH(O(n^2)\INWEBMATH) running time. On randomised data that
    would hardly matter, because it would be so unlikely, but in practical
    cases, data to be sorted is often misaligned only slightly or not at all.
    Many naive implementations of Quicksort have therefore followed Lomuto down
